# Shake to Torch and SOS Flutter App

## Overview

Welcome to the Shake to Torch and SOS Flutter app! This feature-rich app allows users to control the device's torch (flashlight) by shaking the phone and includes an SOS functionality for emergencies. To enhance user control, we've added two switches: one to toggle shake detection and another to activate SOS mode. The app also follows an Android 12-like dynamic adaptive theme for a modern look and feel. We've used the following dependencies to build this versatile app:

1. **shake:** Version 1.0.1
   - Detects shake gestures to activate the torch by shaking the device.

2. **torch_controller:** Version 2.0.1
   - Manages the device's torch, enabling users to turn it on and off through shaking.

3. **flutter_background_service:** Version 5.0.1
   - Ensures the shake detection works even when the app is terminated, providing a seamless experience.

4. **dynamic_colors:** Version (Your preferred version)
   - Provides an Android 12-like dynamic adaptive theme for a visually appealing user interface.
